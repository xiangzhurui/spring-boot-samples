This is a stronger version of no-loop, because the change could now be caused not only by the rule itself. It’s ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you don’t want any rule re-matching and firing again. Only when the ruleflow-group is no longer active or the agenda-group loses the focus those rules with lock-on-active set to true become eligible again for their activations to be placed onto the agenda.
